I like to slip into something good
I see a young girl in the neighbourhood
The way she move, I must confess
I like to run my hands up and down her legs
The way she dress, she look so fine
I'll make her wet, I'll make her mine
She like it hard, she like it slow
All right honey, come on let's go

Baby feel what you want, it's the way she move
Baby feel what you need, come on let's go
