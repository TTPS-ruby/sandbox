The only place where you can dream, 
Living here is not what it seems. 
Ship of white light in the sky, 
Nobody there to reason why.

Here I am, I'm not really there,
smiling faces ever so rare.
A let's walk in deepest space,
living here just isn't the place.

Stalks of light come from the ground,
when I cry there isn't a sound.
All my feelings cannot be held,
I'm happy in my new strange world.
